    <p style="color: green">
      Students are encouraged to seek opportunities and enhance their learning
      experience with practical knowledge. The Career Development Cell provides
      a platform for the students and the companies as well so that the
      collaboration is mutually beneficial. Once a student enters this
      University, the Institution takes the entire responsibility to develop
      that individual into a personality. The students are overwhelmed with the
      opportunities they are provided with. They are left open to umpteen number
      of choices lying in front of them to choose in parallel to their
      academics. Centurion believes in enhancing its students through dedicated
      concentration on each and every student and sees to that everyone enhances
      their talents with the opportunities they are provided with. Once the
      placement season commences, one can feel the vibrant environment on the
      campus. Talents go barely unrecognized at Centurion as we leave no stone
      unturned to place our students. Career Development Cell carries the twin
      responsibility of conducting Career Counseling and Training Programmes,
      and organizing the campus recruitment activities of the School. All
      students are encouraged to attend the training programs for an enhanced
      performance in the campus interviews. We hand hold our students through
      career guidance; through motivational activities and counseling, through
      knowledge sharing activities and through various capacity building
      measures. The trainees are closely monitored for improvements and gauged
      through several VST’s and company Mock tests, until they are ready and
      have gained eligibility. Programs like JAVA Certification in association
      with IBM , Network Certification in association with CISCO, DB2 training
      Certification in association with IBM and Campus Connect in association
      with Infosys are some of the achievements of the center.
