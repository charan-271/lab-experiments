    <h2 style="color: orange">What is Computer Science Engineering?</h2>
    <p style="color: green">
      Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE) involves researching,
      designing, developing, and testing electronic equipment used in various
      systems. Electronics and Communications engineers also conceptualize and
      oversee the manufacturing of communications and broadcast systems. This
      stream of engineering deals with analog transmission, basic electronics,
      microprocessors, solid-state devices, digital and analog communication,
      analog integrated circuits, microwave engineering, satellite
      communication, antennae, and wave progression. It also deals with the
      manufacturing of electronic devices, circuits, and communications
      equipment. In India, Electronics and Communications Engineering is offered
      by various colleges at the UG as well PG level leading to BTech (4 years)
      and MTech (2 years) degrees respectively.
      <br />

      Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) helps build a career in
      the Telecom industry, consumer electronics manufacturing organization,
      Software Industry, Mobile Communication & IT Industry, Power Electronics,
      Healthcare Equipment Manufacturing Industry and several others like that
      of steel and chemicals. The Media and Entertainment industry is often
      deemed as the largest recruiter of ECE Engineers. They are also recruited
      in large numbers in government sectors. Public Sector Undertakings such as
      MTNL, BSNL and IOCL have been recruiting them for a long time. Apart from
      this, many graduates prefer Indian Engineering Service, which is
      considered very prestigious in the engineering field. Electronics and
      Communication Engineering (ECE) Engineers are also employed in the
      Semiconductor and Chip design Industry predominantly. There are always
      options for higher studies to gain more proficiency in the subject. The
      Electronics and Communication Engineering field is growing every day and
      has a huge scope to accommodate eligible young professionals.
